-To Test the Voice Operation Unit, follow these steps:

1. Train the commands using the PreTrainCode after connecting Voice Recognition Module to Arduino Mega
2. Setup the Hierarchical LED Configuration as shown in LED Diagram (LEDs are placeholders of command functions of Other Units)
3. Upload the VoiceOpUnitCode to Arduino 
4. After all the connections on the breadboard, Say the wake word "Hey Buddy"
5. Now the Unit listens for a command (shown in LED Diagram)
6. Set the paramters you want!
