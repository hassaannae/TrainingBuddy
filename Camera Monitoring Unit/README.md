# CAMERA MONITORING UNIT

Aim of the monitoring is hit detection. Chosen method is tracking the ball with computer vision and observing the change in the position of the ball within specific frame-time range.

# DONE

- Detection of a object with color-based filtering

# TODOs

- Need to configure the color-based filtering with respect to ping pong ball
    - Do research for more optimal color-based filtering algorithms for ping pong ball 

- There must be shape-based filtering so that camera can track the ball's position
    - This unit must be able to detect the location of the ball and its distance to the camera. To do that, it must have some references such as table size, ball size, etc.
